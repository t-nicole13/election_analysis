# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview 
For this project, I completed an election audit for The Colorado Board of Elections using the Python programming language.   I did 2 audits, the first only included information on the candidates and the second included voter turnout information.

### Candidate Analysis Tasks
1) Find the total number of votes cast.
2) Create a list of candidates who received votes.
3) Find the percentage of votes each candidate won.
4) Find the winner based on the popular vote.

### Voter Audit Analysis Tasks
1) Find voter turnout for each county.
2) Find the percentage of votes for each county out of the total count.
3) Find the county with the highest voter turnout.
